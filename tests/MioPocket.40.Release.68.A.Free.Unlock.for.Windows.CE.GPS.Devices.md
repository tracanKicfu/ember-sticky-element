# MioPocket 4.0 Release 68: A Free Unlock for Windows CE GPS Devices
 
If you have a GPS device running Windows CE, you might be interested in MioPocket 4.0 Release 68, a free unlock that allows you to use your device for more than just navigation. MioPocket (MEE-oh-pok-it) is an "unlock" for GPS devices (aka PNAs) running Windows CE. Such devices almost always boot into the manufacturer's software with no way to exit it, meaning that you cannot run any other software; i.e. the device is "locked." Unlocking your device allows you to use it for far more than the manufacturer intended (ex. for music, movies, appointments, other navigation apps, etc.) and more like a PDA.

MioPocket comes with just about everything that you might want: three media players (video and audio, nearly all popular formats, including MP3, WMA, AAC, OGG, MP4, H.264/AVC, WMV, MOV, DivX, XviD and more), four e-book readers, multiple dictionaries (including English to 5 languages), dozens of games, two image viewers, two paint programs, MS Office document viewers, text editors, handwritten note-taking apps, four general GPS plotting/mapping apps (good for geocaching), three different appointments/tasks apps, internet apps, registry editors, task managers/switchers, file managers, a contacts app, a calculator, a unit converter, an alarm clock and more (all free/shareware). See the Readme file for a full list.
 
Note: MioPocket does not come with MioMap, iGo, Garmin, TomTom or any other commercial navigation software. Icons are included for them, but not the programs, themselves (since they are not free). What MioPocket is not is a replacement for MioMap, Mobile Navigator or any other OEM navigation software. It is just a frontend from which you may launch the navigation software that came with your device or that you purchase separately.
 
What devices does MioPocket run on? Technically, MioPocket should run on any Windows CE-based device. Despite the name (a nod to the Mio brand), it's evolved to become flexible and not hard-coded to any particular brand or configuration. Every device is slightly different, though, and due to the great many brands and configurations that are out there, the ease of installation and the number of apps and features that actually work will vary. Most major Windows CE-based GPS brands, such as Mio, Magellan, Navigon, Navman, Sanyo and Asus (as well as many other lesser brands, like Becker, Rightway, Insignia, Binatone, Medion, Nextar, Route 66 and Wayteq) have installation instructions in MioPocket's Readme file. For brands that MioPocket does not include specific instructions for, there are also some general instructions for SD-free installation on just about any device.
 
Where can you download MioPocket 4.0 Release 68? Unfortunately, the official website of MioPocket has been shut down entirely. However, you can still find the zip file on Archive.org[^1^] [^2^], where you can download it for free and legally. Just make sure to read the Readme file carefully before installing it on your device.
 
MioPocket 4.0 Release 68 is a great way to unlock the full potential of your Windows CE GPS device. With so many features and applications included in this package, you can turn your device into a mini-computer that can do much more than just show you directions. If you are looking for a way to enhance your GPS experience and have some fun along the way, give MioPocket a try!
